The Landing-page consists of the searcharea, where you can input your desired dancestyle and the city you want the event to be at, as well as a radius to also see events in close proximity. After you input your preferences, you are able to see the output in form of information cards down below. Each card is a summary of all important information regarding the event and shows you a marker on a map, where the event will take place.
